# Please Don't Die
Please Don't Die is a (relatively) simple game.

## Playing

### Controls
`A`, `D`: Move left and right.  
`W`: Jump  
`R`: Teleport back to last checkpoint

### Things
1. You can temporarily hang off of any non-deadly tile.
2. The end of each level is marked by a portal.
3. You can go through some blocks.

## Building

### Linux and Mac
You should be able to use: `./pack.sh` to package everything how it needs to be. You will need DotNet Core 3.1.

### Windows
Probably something related to `msbuild` or Visual Studio.
